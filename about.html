		Since childhood archie has always been driven by curiosity. archie noticed from things that were often overlooked by most and would get devote a lot time in matters he found interesting. At a young age he took curiosity in Physics and Electronics. Often tinkering with house hold electronics and breaking them.

Growing up in cultural hub of Kathmandu, Nepal, surrounded by music and arts, it was for meant for him to take up arts sooner or later. However, it was not until his late teens he really started his journey in arts instead of science. Dipping his feet in the art world firstly through a camera and then moving on to experiment with different mediums. His special interest lie in being able to incorporate Technology and Electronics into traditional medium and the Arts in general.
